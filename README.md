This is a tool to generate ship articles for the eve university wiki.

It uses data from the static data export (SDE), which has been converted to json and checked into the project. It also uses one of the yaml files that is part of the SDE.

The current JSON files are based on a Rubicon 1.3 SDE, which was processed by Steve Ronuken to generate a mysql file, which I then imported and re-exported as JSON.

The typeIDs.yaml is based on the Rubicon 1.4 SDE.
